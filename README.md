Topic : Applying the procedures of a Vending Machine using Finite State Automata
Description: A vending machine system will allow users to buy snacks or drinks from the vending machine if they have the required money for the that specific item. On this challenge, I have been working to describe the Finite State Automata of a Vending Machine using Python. I used Finite Automata module under automata.fa.dfa library in Python to implement the code. Following is the state table of Vending Machine that we used previously in Challenge 1:

Condition 			
1.Vending machine not empty?	F	T	T
2.money inserted?	            X	X	X
3.money is valid?	            X	F	T
4.item selected?	            X	X	X
5.money is sufficient?	      X	X	X
6. Item is available?	        X	X	X
Action 			
1.Accept		                      ✓
2.Reject	                    ✓ ✓
